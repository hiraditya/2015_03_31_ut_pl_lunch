\frame{\frametitle{Why compilers are interesting}
  What sorts of things does a compiler engineer do, day-to-day?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ...working on optimizations, implementing language extensions, reading research papers,
  improving the breadth of support for hardware features, working with several research teams
  (from different labs), writing research papers, retargetting an existing compiler to the
  company's new processor, working on Floating Point arithmetics, static analysis, machine learning ...

  \item Open source compiler engineers collaborate with teams from different companies
  \item Mostly working on state-of-the-art systems and technologies
  \item Programming languages and Computer architecture keep evolving
  \end{itemize}

  Applications:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Compiling programs
  \item Making program faster
  \item Shrinking executable size
  \item Security
  \item Program analysis/transformation
  \item Obfuscation
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  benchmarks
  \begin{itemize}
  \item avoid regressions: correctness, performance
  \item code is fixed, compiler changes
  \end{itemize}

  systems
  \begin{itemize}
  \item program and compiler change
  \item why fixing the compiler when source code can be improved?
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  Compilation process: pass pipeline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Preprocessing
  \item Parsing+Syntax Analysis
  \item Lowering to IR
  \item Optimization
  \item Emitting assembly
  \item Assembler emits object code
  \item Linker generates executable/library
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  Scheduler:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Objective: Moving instructions around for improving performance
  \item Analysis: Alias, Control Flow, Data Dependence
  \item Constraints: Target hardware resources, Compilation time, Memory usage
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  Objective:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Local as well as global scheduling
  \item Moving instructions up/down
  \item Profile information helpful in selecting code patch
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  Analysis:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Data dependence (True, Anti, Output)
  \item Control dependence
  \item Static analysis to identify frequently executed program points
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  Constraints:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cost model to estimate resources
  \item Timing constraints specified by the architecture
  \item Limited program visibility
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  loop transforms
}

\frame{
  autoFDO
  \begin{itemize}
  \item LTO: 6\% speedup on SPEC benchmarks
  \item PGO: -1\% degradation on SPEC
  \item LTO + PGO: 12\% speedup on SPEC
  \end{itemize}
  Non linear speedup, as knowing more about the program helps.
