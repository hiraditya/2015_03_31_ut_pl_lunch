Abstract:

This talk presents current techniques used in compiler development in industry.
The talk touches different aspects of day-to-day activities of a compiler
engineer: performance analysis and monitoring, testcase reduction, bug tracking,
new architecture support, collaboration with open source communities and
different teams across projects, how compiler engineers keep track of several
moving parts in large systems and keep improving performance over time.  The
talk outlines how compilers toolchains drive performance, how the compiler
bridges the gap between HW and SW, and enables SW to exploit new capabilities
of HW.
